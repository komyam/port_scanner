"# port_scanner" 
This Python program implements a simple port scanner tool that allows users to check the status of ports on a specified target IP address or domain name. The program begins by importing necessary libraries such as socket for network connections, datetime for tracking the duration of the scan, and colorama for colored terminal output.
